# Facial Unification
**Facial Unification** is a non-HTTP module for Roblox which converts Dynamic Faces to their classic 2D variants. It works without any kind of a HTTP request. This module was written by me from scratch. I have compiled the face and head IDs for every face which is currently dynamic.
